    <h1>Who is Scrumbo?</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p>Hello! My name is Scrumbo Bumbo, I am a 9th year CS student at Gonzaga University. 
            For the past 3 years I have been researching cheese-based algorithms and how they
            affect the stock market. I code mostly in Chef and Piet, but I have experience with
            some lesser-known langs like Python and C++. I am extremely passionate about cheese 
            and the implications it has on the future of computer science! My favorite cheese-based
            algorithm is ParmeseanTime and I can't wait to learn more!
        </p>
